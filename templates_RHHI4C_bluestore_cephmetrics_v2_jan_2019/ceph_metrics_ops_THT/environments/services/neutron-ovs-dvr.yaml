# A Heat environment file that enables DVR in the overcloud. Used with Compute
# DVR role. Note that the network configuration is consistent with the default
# tripleo network templates so some customization is likely required for
# production deployments.

parameter_defaults:

  # DVR requires that the L2 population feature is enabled
  NeutronMechanismDrivers: ['openvswitch', 'l2population']
  NeutronEnableL2Pop: 'True'

  # Setting NeutronEnableDVR enables distributed routing support in the
  # ML2 plugin and agents that support this feature
  NeutronEnableDVR: true

  # We also need to set the proper agent mode for the L3 agent.  This will only
  # affect the agent on the controller node.
  NeutronL3AgentMode: 'dvr_snat'

  # Enabling DVR deploys additional services to the compute nodes that through
  # normal operation will consume memory. The amount required is roughly
  # proportional to the number of Neutron routers that will be scheduled to
  # that host. It is necessary to reserve memory on the compute nodes to avoid
  # memory issues when creating instances that are connected to routed
  # networks. The current expected consumption is 50 MB per router in addition
  # to the base reserved amount.  Deployers should refer to existing
  # documentation, release notes, etc. for additional information on estimating
  # an appropriate value. The provided value here is based on an estimate of 10
  # routers and is an example value *only* and should be reviewed and modified
  # if necessary before deploying.
  NovaReservedHostMemory: 2560

  # Required if deploying with the ComputeDVR role, which is recommended
  # if using the default network templates as it will configure the
  # host networking to work with the default 'datacentre' network.
