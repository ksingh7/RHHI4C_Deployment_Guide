# This can be useful if you want to create two stacks along side of each
# other. The first stack (doesn't use this environment) and creates
# all of the Neutron networks. The second stack suppresses the
# creation of Networks and shares the same network spaces.

  #FIXME: probably also want to suppress creation of overcloud.yaml VIPs as well
