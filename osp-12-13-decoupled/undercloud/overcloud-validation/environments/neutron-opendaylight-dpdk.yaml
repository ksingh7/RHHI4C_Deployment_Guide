    ## Host configuration Parameters
    #TunedProfileName: "cpu-partitioning"
    #IsolCpusList: ""               # Logical CPUs list to be isolated from the host process (applied via cpu-partitioning tuned).
                                    # It is mandatory to provide isolated cpus for tuned to achive optimal performance.
                                    # Example: "3-8,12-15,18"
    #KernelArgs: ""                 # Space separated kernel args to configure hugepage and IOMMU.
                                    # Deploying DPDK requires enabling hugepages for the overcloud compute nodes.
                                    # It also requires enabling IOMMU when using the VFIO (vfio-pci) OvsDpdkDriverType.
                                    # This should be done by configuring parameters via host-config-and-reboot.yaml environment file.

    ## Attempting to deploy DPDK without appropriate values for the below parameters may lead to unstable deployments
    ## due to CPU contention of DPDK PMD threads.
    ## It is highly recommended to to enable isolcpus (via KernelArgs) on compute overcloud nodes and set the following parameters:
    #OvsDpdkSocketMemory: ""       # Sets the amount of hugepage memory to assign per NUMA node.
                                   # It is recommended to use the socket closest to the PCIe slot used for the
                                   # desired DPDK NIC.  Format should be comma separated per socket string such as:
                                   # "<socket 0 mem MB>,<socket 1 mem MB>", for example: "1024,0".
    #OvsDpdkDriverType: "vfio-pci" # Ensure the Overcloud NIC to be used for DPDK supports this UIO/PMD driver.
    #OvsPmdCoreList: ""            # List or range of CPU cores for PMD threads to be pinned to.  Note, NIC
                                   # location to cores on socket, number of hyper-threaded logical cores, and
                                   # desired number of PMD threads can all play a role in configuring this setting.
                                   # These cores should be on the same socket where OvsDpdkSocketMemory is assigned.
                                   # If using hyperthreading then specify both logical cores that would equal the
                                   # physical core.  Also, specifying more than one core will trigger multiple PMD
                                   # threads to be spawned, which may improve dataplane performance.
    #NovaVcpuPinSet: ""            # Cores to pin Nova instances to.  For maximum performance, select cores
                                   # on the same NUMA node(s) selected for previous settings.
