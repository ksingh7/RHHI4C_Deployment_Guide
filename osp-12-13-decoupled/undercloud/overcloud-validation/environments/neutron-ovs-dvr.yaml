  # DVR requires a port on the external network for each compute node.

  # Please review your network configuration before deploying to ensure that
  # this is appropriate.

parameter_defaults:

  # DVR requires that the L2 population feature is enabled
  NeutronMechanismDrivers: ['openvswitch', 'l2population']
  NeutronEnableL2Pop: 'True'

  # Setting NeutronEnableDVR enables distributed routing support in the
  # ML2 plugin and agents that support this feature

  # We also need to set the proper agent mode for the L3 agent.  This will only
  # affect the agent on the controller node.

  # Enabling DVR deploys additional services to the compute nodes that through
  # normal operation will consume memory. The amount required is roughly
  # proportional to the number of Neutron routers that will be scheduled to
  # that host. It is necessary to reserve memory on the compute nodes to avoid
  # memory issues when creating instances that are connected to routed
  # networks. The current expected consumption is 50 MB per router in addition
  # to the base reserved amount.  Deployers should refer to existing
  # documentation, release notes, etc. for additional information on estimating
  # an appropriate value. The provided value here is based on an estimate of 10
  # routers and is an example value *only* and should be reviewed and modified
  # if necessary before deploying.
