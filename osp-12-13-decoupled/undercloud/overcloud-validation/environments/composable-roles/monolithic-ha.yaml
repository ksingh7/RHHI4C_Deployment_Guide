# title: Monolithic Controller HA deployment
# description: |
#   A Heat environment that can be used to deploy controller and compute
#   services in an HA configuration with SSL everywhere and network
#   isolation.
#   This should be used with a roles_data.yaml containing the Controller,
#   Compute and CephStorage roles.
#   openstack overcloud roles generate -o ~/roles_data.yaml Controller Compute CephStorage
parameter_defaults:
  # Number of CephStorage nodes to deploy
  # Type: number
  CephStorageCount: 1

  # Format for CephStorage node hostnames Note %index% is translated into the index of the node, e.g 0/1/2 etc and %stackname% is replaced with the stack name e.g overcloud
  # Type: string
  CephStorageHostnameFormat: '%stackname%-cephstorage-%index%'

  # Number of Compute nodes to deploy
  # Type: number
  ComputeCount: 3

  # Format for Compute node hostnames Note %index% is translated into the index of the node, e.g 0/1/2 etc and %stackname% is replaced with the stack name e.g overcloud
  # Type: string

  # Number of Controller nodes to deploy
  # Type: number
  ControllerCount: 3

  # Format for Controller node hostnames Note %index% is translated into the index of the node, e.g 0/1/2 etc and %stackname% is replaced with the stack name e.g overcloud

  # DNS servers to use for the Overcloud
  # Type: comma_delimited_list
  DnsServers: ['8.8.8.8', '8,8.4.4']

  # NTP servers list. Defaulted to pool.ntp.org in order to have a sane default for Pacemaker deployments when not configuring this parameter by default.
