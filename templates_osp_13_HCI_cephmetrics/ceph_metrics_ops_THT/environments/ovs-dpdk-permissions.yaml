# It should NOT be used for upgrade from pike, ocata, newton as the existing
# vhost ports and ovs will be with root permissions. Modifying the ovs to run
# with new user during upgrades will result in errors as the existing files and
# folders need to be updated with new permissions. If this is required during
# the upgrade, it is preferrable to do it externally after upgrade. Once the
# changes has been applied, this environment file can be used for further
# updates and upgrades.
