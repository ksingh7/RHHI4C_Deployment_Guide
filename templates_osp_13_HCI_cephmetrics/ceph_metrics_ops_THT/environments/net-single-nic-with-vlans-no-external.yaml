# This template configures each role to use Vlans on a single nic for
# each isolated network.
# This template assumes use of network-isolation.yaml and should be specified
# last on the CLI as a Heat environment so as to override specific
# registry settings in the network-isolation registry.
#
# FIXME: if/when we add functionality to heatclient to include heat
# environment files we should think about using it here to automatically
# include network-isolation.yaml.
