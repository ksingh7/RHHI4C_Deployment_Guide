# A Heat environment that can be used to deploy a real-time compute node
# Deploying a real-time compute node requires enabling hugepages for the
# overcloud nodes, which is done by default for the ComputeRealTime role.
# However, the CPU pinnings (IsolCpusList and NovaVcpuPinSet) need to be set in
# an environment file like this, according to the hardware used for the
# real-time compute nodes.
# Also the hugepages parameters in KernelArgs should be set accordingly
# the memory of the real-time compute nodes.
# It's also possible to overwrite the default values for other parameters like
# TunedProfileName and ComputeRealTimeImage here.

  ## Only uncomment this line to overwrite the default image name

  ComputeRealTimeParameters:
    ## Host configuration Parameters

    ## You must change these values accordingly to your hardware

                           # It is mandatory to provide isolated cpus for tuned to achive optimal performance.
                           # Example: "3-8,12-15,18"
    NovaVcpuPinSet: "2,3"  # Cores to pin Nova instances to.  For maximum performance, select cores
                           # on the same NUMA node(s) selected for previous settings.
